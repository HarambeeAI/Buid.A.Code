# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)

- Prisma 7.x uses a new config format: datasource URL goes in prisma.config.ts, not in schema.prisma
- Use `prisma-client-js` as the generator provider (not `prisma-client`)
- Prisma validate and generate work without a running database - good for CI/CD
- Use `prisma migrate diff --from-empty --to-schema ./prisma/schema.prisma --script` to preview migration SQL

---

## Iteration 1 - US-001: Core Schema - User, Project, Folder
- What was implemented:
  - Next.js 14+ project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
  - Prisma schema with User, Project, Folder models
  - User model: UUID id, logto_user_id (unique), email, name, tier (FREE/PRO default FREE), analyses_remaining (default 2, nullable), role (USER/ADMIN default USER), timestamps

---

## Iteration 8 - US-008: Logto Webhook - User Sync
- What was implemented:
  - POST /api/webhooks/logto endpoint for handling Logto webhook events
  - HMAC-SHA256 signature validation using `logto-signature-sha-256` header
  - User.Created event handling: creates user with tier=FREE, analyses_remaining=2, role=USER
  - Uses upsert to handle duplicate user creation gracefully (updates email/name if user exists)
  - Added LOGTO_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY to .env.example
- Files changed:
  - app/src/app/api/webhooks/logto/route.ts (new) - Webhook handler
  - app/.env.example (modified) - Added LOGTO_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Logto webhooks use `logto-signature-sha-256` header for HMAC signature
  - Event names are PascalCase (e.g., "User.Created" not "user.created")
  - Always use upsert for webhook handlers to handle duplicate deliveries
  - Get raw body with `request.text()` before parsing JSON for signature verification
---

## Iteration 9 - US-009: GET /api/auth/me
- What was implemented:
  - GET /api/auth/me endpoint for fetching authenticated user profile
  - Validates JWT via Logto session using existing requireAuth() helper
  - Fetches user from database using logto_user_id from session
  - Returns { id, email, name, tier, analyses_remaining, role }
  - Returns 401 if not authenticated, 404 if user not in database
- Files changed:
  - app/src/app/api/auth/me/route.ts (new) - User profile endpoint
  - PRD.md (modified) - Marked US-009 complete
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - The existing auth.ts requireAuth() pattern works well for API routes
  - Use Prisma select to return only needed fields for security and performance
  - Logto session userId maps to logto_user_id in our User model
---

## Iteration 10 - US-010: Project CRUD
- What was implemented:
  - POST /api/projects - creates project with name, description, folder_id (optional)
  - GET /api/projects - lists projects with pagination (page, limit params), includes analysis_count
  - GET /api/projects/:id - returns project detail, 403 if not owner
  - PATCH /api/projects/:id - updates project fields, 403 if not owner
  - DELETE /api/projects/:id - deletes project with cascade to analyses
  - All endpoints require authentication (401 if not authenticated)
  - Folder ownership validated when assigning folder_id
  - Zod validation for all inputs
- Files changed:
  - app/src/app/api/projects/route.ts (new) - POST and GET list endpoints
  - app/src/app/api/projects/[id]/route.ts (new) - GET detail, PATCH, DELETE endpoints
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Use zod's `.issues[0].message` not `.errors[0].message` for error messages
  - Next.js 15+ dynamic route params are async: use `await context.params`
  - Transform Prisma `_count` relations to flat fields for cleaner API responses
  - Use `z.coerce.number()` for query params that come as strings
---

## Iteration 11 - US-011: Folder CRUD
- What was implemented:
  - POST /api/folders - creates a folder with name, returns folder with id, name, created_at
  - GET /api/folders - lists all folders for user with project_count, ordered by name
  - PATCH /api/folders/:id - renames a folder, 403 if not owner
  - DELETE /api/folders/:id - sets folder_id to null on projects in folder, then deletes folder (via transaction)
  - All endpoints require authentication (401 if not authenticated)
  - Zod validation for all inputs
- Files changed:
  - app/src/app/api/folders/route.ts (new) - POST and GET list endpoints
  - app/src/app/api/folders/[id]/route.ts (new) - PATCH and DELETE endpoints
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Use Prisma $transaction for operations that need atomicity (e.g., update projects then delete folder)
  - Folder delete uses SetNull behavior defined in schema, but explicit updateMany + delete in transaction is safer for clarity
---

## Iteration 12 - US-012: Analysis Creation with Tier Validation
- What was implemented:
  - POST /api/projects/:pid/analyses - creates analysis with tier-based validation
  - GET /api/projects/:pid/analyses - lists analyses for a project with pagination
  - Generates unique report_ref in BAC-YYYY-NNNNN format (timestamp + random for uniqueness)
  - FREE tier validation: page_count <= 5, codes <= 3, analyses_remaining > 0
  - FREE tier: decrements analyses_remaining on successful creation using transaction
  - PRO tier validation: page_count <= 50, no code limit
  - Returns 403 with specific error codes (PAGE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED, CODE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED, ANALYSES_EXHAUSTED)
  - Sets status=PENDING on creation
  - All endpoints require authentication and project ownership verification
  - Zod validation for all inputs
- Files changed:
  - app/src/app/api/projects/[pid]/analyses/route.ts (new) - POST and GET endpoints
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Use $transaction for operations that need atomicity (decrement remaining + create analysis)
  - Report ref generation should handle collisions with retry + fallback to UUID approach
  - Return specific error codes in 403 responses to help UI display appropriate upgrade CTAs
  - Next.js 15+ uses [pid] pattern for nested dynamic routes
