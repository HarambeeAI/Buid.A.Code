# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)

- Prisma 7.x uses a new config format: datasource URL goes in prisma.config.ts, not in schema.prisma
- Use `prisma-client-js` as the generator provider (not `prisma-client`)
- Prisma validate and generate work without a running database - good for CI/CD
- Use `prisma migrate diff --from-empty --to-schema ./prisma/schema.prisma --script` to preview migration SQL

---

## Iteration 1 - US-001: Core Schema - User, Project, Folder
- What was implemented:
  - Next.js 14+ project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
  - Prisma schema with User, Project, Folder models

  - 12 CodeRequirement records for IRC 2021 across categories (STRUCTURAL, FIRE_SAFETY, EGRESS, ACCESSIBILITY, ENERGY, GENERAL_BUILDING, PLUMBING) - all PUBLISHED status
  - Each CodeRequirement has complete fields including extraction_guidance and evaluation_guidance
  - Uses upsert to handle re-running the seed safely

---

## Iteration 8 - US-008: Logto Webhook - User Sync
- What was implemented:
  - POST /api/webhooks/logto endpoint for handling Logto webhook events
  - HMAC-SHA256 signature validation using `logto-signature-sha-256` header

- Files changed:
  - app/src/app/api/auth/me/route.ts (new) - User profile endpoint
  - PRD.md (modified) - Marked US-009 complete
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - The existing auth.ts requireAuth() pattern works well for API routes

  - Zod validation for all inputs
- Files changed:
  - app/src/app/api/folders/route.ts (new) - POST and GET list endpoints

- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Use Prisma $transaction for operations that need atomicity (e.g., update projects then delete folder)
  - Folder delete uses SetNull behavior defined in schema, but explicit updateMany + delete in transaction is safer for clarity
---

## Iteration 12 - US-012: Analysis Creation with Tier Validation
- What was implemented:
  - POST /api/projects/:pid/analyses - creates analysis with tier-based validation
  - GET /api/projects/:pid/analyses - lists analyses for a project with pagination
  - Generates unique report_ref in BAC-YYYY-NNNNN format (timestamp + random for uniqueness)

  - All endpoints require authentication and project ownership verification
  - Zod validation for all inputs
- Files changed:
  - app/src/app/api/projects/[pid]/analyses/route.ts (new) - POST and GET endpoints

  - Report ref generation should handle collisions with retry + fallback to UUID approach
  - Return specific error codes in 403 responses to help UI display appropriate upgrade CTAs
  - Next.js 15+ uses [pid] pattern for nested dynamic routes
---

  - Filter params need explicit type casting for enum values in where clause
---

  - UUID validation for analysis ID parameter
  - All endpoints require authentication
- Files changed:
  - app/src/app/api/analyses/[id]/status/route.ts (new) - Lightweight status endpoint
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Use Prisma select to fetch only needed fields for performance-sensitive endpoints
  - Return same 404 error for both "not found" and "not owned" to prevent information leakage
  - Status endpoint pattern: minimal payload, single DB query, no nested relations except for ownership check

- Learnings for future iterations:
  - AWS Signature V4 requires specific header ordering and canonical request format
  - For PDF page count, /Count pattern in trailer is most reliable; /N is for linearized PDFs
  - Use Range header to fetch only PDF trailer (last 10KB) for page count detection
  - File key should include user ID prefix for ownership verification
  - Presigned URLs need content-type in signed headers for PUT operations
---

  - Convert Buffer to Uint8Array for NextResponse compatibility
  - Check user.tier for Pro-only features, return upgrade_url in 403 response

  - Match dynamic route param names across nested routes (e.g., [id] everywhere, not mixed [id] and [pid])
  - Use mock NextRequest for server components that need Logto context
  - Client components need "use client" directive and mounted check to avoid hydration mismatch
